v1.0

v1.1
Training Algorithm
	make each population train against the same random seed. 
		It seems like some individuals are getting lucky and seem to be doing really well when their not very good

v1.2
Save/Restore Training Progress
	make a separate directory structure to organize and store training progress.
	ex:
		|-outDir
		|---training_progress
		|	|---session_001
		|	|	|---generation_001.txt
		|	|	|---generation_002.txt
		|	|---session_002
		|	|	|---generation_001.txt
		|	|	|---generation_002.txt
		|	|	|---generation_003.txt

	Make sure to print destination directory everytime we save data

	Figure out a good way to restore progress (this really becomes more practical with program options)
	Really depends on filesystems and program_options.
