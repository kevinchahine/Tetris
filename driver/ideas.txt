=== Heuristics ===
	Make height feature exponensial. So that low heights are less significant and higher
	heights are more significant than other weights.

	Clear pieces before evaluating fitness. DFS3 seems to avoid using its held I pieces
	because it doesn't know that clearing lines is good.

=== Game Mechanics ===
	Make a special move for placing pieces. 
	Make it operate like a down move.
	Make sure SolutionSequences don't move the piece down when appending a place move
